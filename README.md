## About GraphDBLP

**GraphDBLP** is a tool that models the [DBLP bibliography](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/) as a graph database for performing graph-based queries and social network analyses.

**GraphDBLP** also enriches the DBLP data through semantic keyword similarities computed via [word-embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf). **GraphDBLP** provides to users three meaningful queries for exploring the DBLP community:
1. investigate author profiles by analysing their publication records;
2. identify the most prolific authors on a given topic;
3. perform social network analyses over the whole community;
4. perform shortest-paths over DBLP (e.g., the shortest-path between authors, the analysis of co-author networks, etc.) 

# Installation
You can install GraphDBLP in 5 steps as follows.

## Step1: Download Neo4j
GraphDBLP is built on top of Neo4j graph-database. This means you have to download [Neo4j graph-database](https://neo4j.com/download/). Notice that GraphDBLP has been built on Neo4j Community Edition 3.2.5. We suggest to download Neo4j Desktop and then deploy a new GraphDB instance we call "GraphDBLP" using the Neo4j Community Edition 3.2.5.
## Step2: Download GraphDBLP database dump 
Download the [dump file](https://goo.gl/Cy1AH1) that contains the whole GraphDBLP database in a local folder (e.g., Download). The procedures that transform DBLP into a graph-database are time consuming and discussed in [the paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-017-5503-2). Here, for your convencience, we recommend to import the GraphDBLP database instance into your local Graph-database instance as follows.
## Step3: Build the Graph instance
Open the Neo4j Desktop app. Here press "Manage" and then "Terminal". Move to bin directory with `cd bin` then type `./neo4j-admin load --from=path_to_your_donwload_folder/graph.db.dump --force`. This operation may take a while. Please do not close the window while running.
## Step4: Run GraphDBLP
4. Just press the Start button to run GraphDB instance through the Neo4j Desktop app. Notice that the first run may take a while.
## Step5: Tune GraphDBLP resources to improve response-time [optional]
As some GraphDBLP queries are time and memory consuming, we suggest to increase the memory available to Neo4j. This can be easily done through Neo4j Desktop App-->Manage-->Settings. Here just modify the rows `dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=512m` and `dbms.memory.heap.max_size=1G` with the desired settings. The higher, the better. Remember to restart the sever in case of changes.

# Usage through Python 
Clearly, we assume you have a Python > 2.x shell installed on your machine.

Open a terminal and go to the GraphDBLP folder you downloaded (or cloned). Then type `python ./GraphDBLP.py ` and select one of the following arguments:
1. `-q1 keyword limit` Execute the query number 1 for **AUTHOR PROFILING**. This allows users to identify the most prolific authors in the DBLP community for a given keyword. This requires to specify also the keyword to be used and the limit value for results. Example: -q1 'multimedia' 10 will perform query 1 using multimedia as keyword and collecting top 10 results. The meaning of 'relevance', 'score' and 'prolificness' are discussed in the paper
2. `-q2 author-name-surname limit similarity-threshold` Execute query number 2 for **AUTHOR PUBLICATION RECORDS COMPARISON**. This query starts from the keywords describing an authorâ€™s research activities i.e., the keywords connected through the has research topic edges. For each keyword, the most pro- ficient author in the field is identified, and the related data are retrieved: (prolific) author name, score, relevance, and related keywords. This requires to specify also the keyword to be used, the max number of researchers to be considered for each keyword and the similarity threshold value for similar keywords. Example: `-q2 'John von Neumann' 3 0.4` will perform query #2 profiling the publication record of John von Neumann and retrieving up to 3 top researchers for each keyword appearing the in profile of John von Neumann. In addition, for each keyword, only keywords with a similarity value grater than 0.4 will be returned
3. `-q3 venue-name similarity-threshold` Execute query #3 for **COMPUTING LOCAL CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT ON RESEARCH COMMUNITIES**. This requires to specify the venue name and a threshold value for computing the similarity. Example: `-q3 'ijcai' 10` percent will perform query 3 computing the community starting from ijcai and considering venue with a similarity value with at least 10 percent.
4. `-q4 author1-name-surname author2-name-surname rel-to-be-navigated limit` Execute query #4 for **SHORTEST PATHS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS**. This requires to specify the name of two researchers to be connected, the relationships that can be navigated separated by a pipe | and the max number of paths to be returned. Example: `-q4 'John von Neumann' 'Moshe Y. Vardi' 'authored|contains' 1`

# Usage through Neo4j Shell

**GraphDBLP** is built on top of Neo4j. This means you can perform any query using the [Cypher query language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/). Once the Neo4j instance is running, open your browser at [localhost:7474/browser/](localhost:7474/browser/ )

# Disclaimer

GraphDBLP is an experimental tool developed as a proof of concepts to empirically verify some how a graph-based analysis can be performed over the well known DBLP computer science biography.  
This means there could be bugs, or queries that need for better optimisation, refinement or improvement. The aim behind this project is to show that computer science bibliography can be queried as a graph. If you aim at joining this project please contact us!

**GraphDBLP** makes use of:
1. Neo4j as graph-database for querying the knowledge base
2. The keywords here included have been identified by the [FacetedDBLP](http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php) project.
