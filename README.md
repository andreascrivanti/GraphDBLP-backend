## About GraphDBLP

**GraphDBLP** is a tool that models the [DBLP bibliography](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/) as a graph database for performing graph-based queries and social network analyses.

**GraphDBLP** also enriches the DBLP data through semantic keyword similarities computed via [word-embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf). **GraphDBLP** provides to users three meaningful queries for exploring the DBLP community:
1. investigate author profiles by analysing their publication records;
2. identify the most prolific authors on a given topic;
3. perform social network analyses over the whole community;
4. perform shortest-paths over DBLP (e.g., the shortest-path between authors, the analysis of co-author networks, etc.)
